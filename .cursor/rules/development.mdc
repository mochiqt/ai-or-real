# Development Workflow

## Package Manager
- **Always use `pnpm`** - never use npm, yarn, or bun for package management
- Install dependencies: `pnpm install`
- Run scripts: `pnpm dev`, `pnpm build`, etc.

## Development Server
- Dev server runs continuously during development
- **Never start a new `pnpm run dev` process** - check if one is already running
- Use the existing dev server if available

## Working Directory
- Project opens in correct root directory in Cursor
- **Never use `cd`** to project root - only cd into subdirectories when necessary
- Current working directory is always `/Users/mochiqt/Repos/ai-or-real`

## Git Commands
- **Never use git stash, git add, or git commit** unless explicitly requested
- Only use git commands when the task specifically requires them
- Do not proactively suggest git operations

## Code Quality

### Linting
- Run `pnpm lint` to check code quality
- ESLint configuration in `eslint.config.js`
- Fix issues before committing

### Type Checking
- Run `pnpm check` for TypeScript type checking
- Use `pnpm check:watch` for continuous type checking
- Fix all type errors before committing

### Svelte Validation
- Always use MCP Svelte for syntax validation when writing Svelte code
- Check syntax after making changes to Svelte components
- Fix all Svelte 5 syntax issues

## Testing
- Test components manually in dev server
- Verify localStorage/sessionStorage persistence
- Test responsive design on mobile breakpoints

## Build
- Run `pnpm build` to create production build
- Test production build with `pnpm preview`
- Ensure no build errors or warnings
