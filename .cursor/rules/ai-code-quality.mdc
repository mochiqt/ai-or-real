# AI Code Quality Standards

## Avoid AI Code Slop

### Type Casts
- **Never use `as any`** - use proper type guards instead
- **Never use unsafe type casts** like `as Type` without validation
- Use type guards to validate before casting

### Defensive Checks
- Don't add unnecessary try/catch blocks in trusted code paths
- Don't add defensive checks that are abnormal for the codebase
- Trust validated data once it's been validated

### Comments
- Avoid unnecessary comments that explain obvious code
- Don't add comments that are inconsistent with the file style
- Prefer self-documenting code over comments
- Remove AI-generated comment slop

### Async/Await
- Don't mark functions as `async` unless they actually `await` something
- Remove unnecessary `async/await` from simple functions
- Prefer synchronous code when possible

### Code Style
- Follow existing code style in the file
- Don't mix different patterns within the same file
- Keep consistency with the rest of the codebase
- Match the indentation and formatting style
